We can find that once teams enter playoff, their average points are very close to each other, on the other word, their skills are quite similar, that’s why playoff in NBA is usually more interesting than the regular season, because every team has the chance to win. In conclusion, if we only look at the points each team get on average during playoff, they are very similar with each other. Only the bottom few perform a little worse. While we look back in regular season, things are quite different. There is a very clear difference in the points between the teams who did or did not enter playoff. As we can see that first 16 teams (who entered the playoff) still have very similar points gain, while in last 14 teams (who did not enter playoff), their points gain dropped with the ranking. On the other word, we can say that the NBA’s official competition system is very reasonable. It screens out strong teams and weak teams very well, and the playoffs are even more exciting because of that. 4.2 2. 3 Point Field Goals with Rank in Playoff and Regular Season library(patchwork) #plot scatter plot with smooth line in playoff about 3 points g_playoff &lt;- ggplot(data = playoff,aes(x=Rank, y=X3PM))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=X3PM))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ggtitle(&#39;3 Point Field Goals Made and 3 Point\\nField Goals Percentage in Playoff&#39;)+ ylab(&#39;3 Point Field Goals Made&#39;) g_playoff2 &lt;- ggplot(data = playoff,aes(x=Rank, y=X3P.))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=X3P.))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ylab(&#39;3 Point Field Goals Percentage&#39;) g_playoff / g_playoff2 + plot_layout(guides = &#39;collect&#39;) #plot scatter plot with smooth line in regular about 3 points g_regular &lt;- ggplot(data = regular,aes(x=Rank, y=X3PM))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team,shape=Enter))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=X3PM))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ggtitle(&#39;3 Point Field Goals Made and 3 Point\\nField Goals Percentage in Regular&#39;)+ ylab(&#39;3 Point Field Goals Made&#39;) g_regular2 &lt;- ggplot(data = regular,aes(x=Rank, y=X3P.))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team,shape=Enter))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=X3P.))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ylab(&#39;3 Point Field Goals Percentage&#39;) g_regular / g_regular2 + plot_layout(guides = &#39;collect&#39;) We now analyze the 3 Point Field performance. We first start with playoff. The trend in playoff about 3 Point is quite similar to total points, their average 3 point goals have very little differences. However, interestingly, when we check the 3 point goals percentage, we can see that the last team has the highest percentage, which means it has highest three-point field goal percentage. This can be explained by the level gap, or on the other word, although it looks like every team in playoff has very similar points goals, because of the level gap, weak teams have less offensive ability on the basketball court, the way to catch up with the strong teams is to shoot more three points. But unfortunately, this is a good strategy when fight with weak teams but not usually work with strong teams. That’s why it ranked 16 in playoff. When we look at regular season, will can find that strong teams (who enter playoff) have both the high 3 point goals made and 3 point goals percentage. Top ranked teams among weak teams (do not enter playoff) have both low 3 point goals made and 3 point goals percentage. However, those last few teams have a very high 3 point goals made but lowest 3 point goals percentage. It can also be explained by the level gap. Strong teams are always strong, they can make 3 point easier and offensive efficiently. Top ranked teams among weak teams may have good offensive abilities, but they lack the 3 points goals to open up the gap in order to win, that’s why they lose. While the last few teams, they are desperately to shoot more 3 points in order to get the points, they are weak in offensive so that they have to shoot 3 points, but they also not good at it, that’s why their percentages are so low either. 4.3 2. Field Goal with Rank in Playoff and Regular Season #plot scatter plot with smooth line in playoff about field goals g_playoff &lt;- ggplot(data = playoff,aes(x=Rank, y=FGM))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank)))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ggtitle(&#39;Field Goals Made and Field Goals \\nPercentage in Playoff&#39;)+ ylab(&#39;Field Goals Made&#39;) g_playoff2 &lt;- ggplot(data = playoff,aes(x=Rank, y=FG.))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=FG.))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ylab(&#39;Field Goals Percentage&#39;) g_playoff / g_playoff2 + plot_layout(guides = &#39;collect&#39;) #plot scatter plot with smooth line in regular about field goals g_regular &lt;- ggplot(data = regular,aes(x=Rank, y=FGM))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team,shape=Enter))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=FGM))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ggtitle(&#39;Field Goals Made and Field Goals \\nPercentage in Regular&#39;)+ ylab(&#39;Field Goals Made&#39;) g_regular2 &lt;- ggplot(data = regular,aes(x=Rank, y=FG.))+ geom_point(size=3.0,stroke=0.1,aes(color=Team,shape=Enter))+ geom_smooth(aes(x=as.integer(Rank), y=FG.))+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+ ylab(&#39;Field Goals Percentage&#39;) g_regular / g_regular2 + plot_layout(guides = &#39;collect&#39;) Then we look at the general field goals performance. This is the most critical factor that reflects a team’s performance because most of the time, a team win points through general field goals. In playoff, things are a bit different now, although the trend is very weak, field goals made drops slightly as rank drops while in field goals percentage, they are quite similar. That means each team’s shooting percentage is similar, all of them can shoot very good. However, stronger teams have more opportunities to shoot because of their stronger offensive abilities. That’s why they can win. And we can conclude that although each team in playoff is strong, they still have subtle level gap. In regular season this trend becomes very notable. Strong teams always have higher field goals made and field goals percentage while weak teams have lower. They have a very clear level gap.
